Certainly! Integrating Google Pay involves both frontend (Flutter) and backend (Node.js) development. Here's a basic example to get you started:

Flutter (Frontend):
Add Dependencies:
In your pubspec.yaml file, add the google_pay package:

yaml
Copy code
dependencies:
  flutter:
    sdk: flutter
  google_pay: ^0.1.3 # Check for the latest version on pub.dev
Import the Package:
In your Dart file, import the package:

dart
Copy code
import 'package:google_pay/google_pay.dart';
Initialize Google Pay:
Initialize Google Pay with your merchant ID. This should be done in a Flutter widget's lifecycle method, such as initState:

dart
Copy code
@override
void initState() {
  super.initState();
  GooglePay.initialize(merchantId: "your_merchant_id");
}
Create Payment Button:
Create a button to trigger the Google Pay payment process:

dart
Copy code
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    final paymentData = await GooglePay.checkPaymentPossibility();
    if (paymentData != null) {
      // Proceed with the payment
      // You may want to send paymentData to your backend for processing
    } else {
      // Google Pay is not available on this device
    }
  },
  child: Text("Pay with Google Pay"),
)
Node.js (Backend):
Install Packages:
Use npm to install necessary packages for your Node.js backend:

bash
Copy code
npm install express body-parser cors
Create Express Server:
Set up a basic Express server to handle payment requests:

javascript
Copy code
const express = require('express');
const bodyParser = require('body-parser');
const cors = require('cors');
const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.json());
app.use(cors());

const PORT = 3000;

app.post('/process-payment', (req, res) => {
  // Handle payment processing logic here
  // You will receive payment information from the frontend
  // Perform necessary validations and process the payment

  // Example: Log payment information
  console.log('Payment Data:', req.body);

  res.json({ success: true, message: 'Payment processed successfully' });
});

app.listen(PORT, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${PORT}`);
});
Handle Google Pay Data on the Frontend:
Send the payment information to your Node.js backend for processing:

dart
Copy code
ElevatedButton(
  onPressed: () async {
    final paymentData = await GooglePay.checkPaymentPossibility();
    if (paymentData != null) {
      // Send paymentData to your Node.js backend
      final response = await http.post(
        'http://your-backend-url/process-payment',
        body: paymentData,
        headers: {'Content-Type': 'application/json'},
      );

      // Handle the response from the backend
      print(response.body);
    } else {
      // Google Pay is not available on this device
    }
  },
  child: Text("Pay with Google Pay"),
)
Secure Your Endpoints:
Implement proper security measures in your Node.js backend, such as validating the payment information and using secure connections (HTTPS).

Remember that this is a basic example, and in a production environment, you should implement additional security measures, handle errors, and comply with Google Pay's and your payment processor's guidelines.

Always refer to the official documentation for the latest and detailed information on Google Pay integration.
